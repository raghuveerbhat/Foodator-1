A food based social media android application that detect and classify food types based on input picture taken from camera. After classfying the food type, we use zomato API to find the nearest restaurants where we can get that food. Also, we fetch nutitional information along with ingredients and steps to prepare the food in your home.

Everything from UI to deep learning model (training and deployment) is done from scratch.
